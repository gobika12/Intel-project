Problem Statement
Predicting Petal Length of Iris Flowers Using Machine Learning

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the petal length of an Iris flower based on other flower characteristics such as sepal length, sepal width, and petal width.

Using the Iris dataset, we employ a Random Forest Regressor to train a predictive model. The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, and the model's performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Additionally, we visualize the actual vs. predicted petal length values using a scatter plot to assess model accuracy.

Key Objectives
Preprocess the dataset: Remove unnecessary columns and define features/target variables.
Train a regression model: Use the Random Forest Regressor to learn the relationship between features and petal length.
Evaluate model performance: Compute MAE and MSE to measure prediction accuracy.
Visualize results: Compare actual vs. predicted values using a scatter plot.
This project helps in understanding supervised learning (regression) and how different flower characteristics influence petal length predictions. ðŸš€
